Github Lab 1: Collaboration

Instructions: In this lab we will play a game of literary ‘exquisite corpse’. The idea is we will write a story where each student writes one paragraph of the story based on the last paragraph. 

For this assignment please edit this file by opening it into a text program like TextEdit / Microsoft Word. Please keep the story PG. No use of cursing, racism, sexist, homophobia, intense graphic violence imagery, overt sexual speech will be tolerated. When you start your paragraph please write your name at the top.

When you are done with the paragraph please separate your section by using the a line of underscores. You can do this by holding shift + hypen (-)

It was a dark and stormy night in the city of San Francisco

It was just before Halloween

And the boy stared at the spirit that waved at him from across his bedroom window.

The ghost said his name was Earl and he lived during the original 1849 San Francisco Gold Rush

Seeing a 49ers’ pennant hanging on the boy’s wall, Earl was shocked his image is being used as the mascot for a sports team.

Reacting to Earl, the boy asked if he wanted to see the pennant.

But Earl didn't seem very much interested.

The boy asks Earl about his life during the gold rush but he doesn’t seem to want to talk about it. Earl just stares at his toy chest stoically.

"Sheesh," says the boy, "you sure are one boring ghost." And he turns to get the vaccuum cleaner, as he had seen in Ghostbusters.

The boy attacks Earl with his vacuum (set to full suction) aiming at Earl's chest, he sucked a gaping hole from the ghost's body revealing 1,000 large gold nuggets. That's why earl kept looking down at his chest.

"Woah, what are those?" asks the boy. Earl replies,"These are gold nuggets, I have to keep them somewhere safe before someone finds them."
